# KKLtoKisekae Public Release

## Author: Gabriel Misajlovski (Ebagigi)

# Description

KKLtoKisekae is an application that works as an in-between for two other applications (KKL and Kisekae). These are both dress-up games that use txt files as saves. KKL is an extension
of kisekae that has backwards compatibility, meaning a save from kisekae will work when loaded into KKL. The reverse, however is not true, and Kisekae is a lot more
widely used and easily accessible than KKL. Therefore, I decided to make a program that takes a txt save file from kkl that you give it, and returns a kisekae txt save file, as there is
no easy way to manipulate the saves efficiently.




Disclaimer: This is a program I created by myself, and this is my first ever full program, so there will probably be bugs and other issues. 



KKLtoKisekae was written in C++ utilizing Qt and CMake for program compilation and design.
